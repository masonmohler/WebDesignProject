            <h3>HTML5 Reference</h3>
            <p>
              I have created a website that functions as my own personal HTML5
              reference document. This website was created with pure HTML and
              CSS for my ITEC 3610 class.

            <h3>Madman Salsa</h3>
            <p>
              I created this website for my Dad's friend Robert, who owns the
              Madman Salsa brand. He sells his salsa and dips at the local
              farmer's market, but he needed a website so that people from
              around Arkansas could hear his story, view his menu, and contact
              him through email or Facebook.

            <h3>Segway: Simply Moving</h3>
            <p>
              I made this website for my IFSC 1310 course. It is a website that
              shows off the new Segway concept: the Centaur. It was made with
              pure HTML and CSS, and includes a contact form powered by Wufoo.

          <h3>My Websites</h3>
          <p>
            Over the past few years, I have been honing my skills of website
            design and creation. Not only have I completed several courses about
            web development, but I have also taken on several personal projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the left, you'll see a few of my favorite websites that I have
            designed and developed over the past year. You can visit these
            websites yourself by clicking the button under each description, but
            I have also included a brief screen recording that walks through the
            websites for your convienence.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see, in the past I have favored the single column layout.
            However, after this semester and learning more about web design
            principles, I have started to favor a 2 column design. The 2 column
            design makes it easier to folow the F-design pattern, and I create
            mostly text-based sites, so it makes more sense for me to use the 2
            columns for most applications.
