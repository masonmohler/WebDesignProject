          <h3>My Music</h3>
          <p>
            I've been making music for much longer than I've been making art or
            websites. Music was one of my first passions, and many of my
            Christmas and birthday gifts over the years have been musical
            instruments or software. The past few years, I've really focused on
            using FL Studio, a music production software, to make lofi music.
          </p>
          <h3>What is Lofi?</h3>
          <p>
            Lofi music, short for "low fidelity," is a genre that captivates
            listeners with its distinctive charm and mellow vibes. Rooted in
            simplicity and characterized by its intentionally unpolished
            quality, lofi music creates a tranquil soundscape that serves as a
            sonic sanctuary for many.
          </p>
          <p>
            At its core, lofi embraces imperfections, often featuring soft
            background noise, vinyl crackles, and deliberate lo-fi recording
            techniques. This intentional rawness gives the music an authentic
            and nostalgic feel, as if it's echoing from a cozy, well-loved
            record player.
