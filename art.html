          <h3>My Art</h3>
          <p>
            While I am pursuing a career in web design, I have recently fallen
            in love with creating physical art. Learning about the theory of art
            in my 2D Design class and the application of those theories in my
            Basic Drawing class, I have been able to create several works of art
            that I genuinely feel are good pieces.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the left, you'll find a collection of the art I have created this
            year. I have spent over 100 hours this semester alone on these
            pieces, and they have taught me so much about the rules of design
            and the creation of good art.
          </p>
          <h3>My Journey</h3>
          <p>
            At the beginning of this semster, I was not a good artist, but I
            desperately wanted to be. Throughout my courses, I have learned
            about composition, the use of line, shape, form, value, texture,
            perspective, and color to create visual representations of concrete
            things and abstract concepts. I have also focused on learning about
            and using different materials to learn what I like best.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have decided that my favorite material is either hand-cut paper,
            or ink pens. As you can see in my value and color projects for 2D
            design, I was able to create some interesting compositions with
            hand-cut paper, and I really liked that the finished pieces felt
            less fragil than the ones I made with chracoal or graphite. With the
            ink project, which is listed last on the page, I used my favorite
            ink pen: the Uniball Deluxe 0.7mm Roller Pen. I went through almost
            4 of them on that project alone, but I learned that I really loved
            working with pens for the same reason I liked hand-cut paper: the
            permanance.
