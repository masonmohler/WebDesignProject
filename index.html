          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Hi! My name is Mason Mohler and I am a Junior at UA Little Rock. I
            am a Web Design and Development major as well as the president of my
            fraternity. I consider myself to be a continual learner, and I have
            an enormous passion for leadership.
          </p>
          <p>
            I recently led my fraternity to our most successful recruitment
            period in two decades, a testament to the power of creative
            leadership. This experience has taught me that fostering meaningful
            connections among individuals is crucial to the success of any
            project.
          </p>
          <h3>This Website</h3>
          <p>
            On this website, you will find pictures of my art and links to
            websites I have created, along with information on how to contact
            me.
